Build a sophisticated, futuristic web application called **InvoiceAI Portal**.



## Core Functionality



### 1. Invoice Upload Portal

- Users can drag & drop or upload PDF, DOCX, .txt or image invoices.

- User can also add text input which can be like "received from "Name" Rs 3000" and it should also be parsed.

- User can also speak using a mic button instead of typing and provide details of invoice so that it can be parsed.

- Multiple file upload support with progress bar.

- Clean, minimal dashboard with futuristic UI elements (glassmorphism, subtle gradients, rounded corners).



### 2. AI Invoice Parsing

- Once uploaded, invoices are automatically sent to an AI model that extracts:

	- Vendor/payee name

	- Invoice number

	- Date

	- Line items (description, quantity, price, subtotal)

	- Taxes & totals

- Display extracted data in a structured, editable table before submission.



### 3. Database Integration

- Parsed invoice data is saved into a a (e.g., Firebase, Supabase, or PostgreSQL).

- Parsed invoice data is saved into a google sheet name stroke_art_invoice.gsheet

- Users can search, filter, and view past invoices.

- Option to export data as CSV or Excel.



### 4. User Authentication & Roles

- Secure login/signup with email + OAuth (Google, Microsoft).

- Roles: Admin (full control), Accountant (view/edit), Viewer (read-only).



### 5. Analytics Dashboard

- Summary of invoices processed this month, total spend, top vendors.

- Charts/graphs for spending trends over time (use a charting library like Recharts or Chart.js).



### 6. UI/UX Design

- Futuristic, sleek, and professional.

- Dark mode + light mode toggle.

- Smooth animations with Framer Motion.

- Sidebar navigation (Upload, Invoices, Analytics, Settings).



### 7. Additional Features

- Error handling & notifications (toast messages for success/failure).

- Multi-language support.

- Settings page for managing API keys, export options, and team members.

- AI auto-categorization of invoices by expense type (e.g., utilities, marketing, payroll).



## Tech Stack (Suggested)

- **Frontend:** React + TailwindCSS + shadcn/ui + Framer Motion

- **Backend:** Node.js/Express or Next.js API routes

- **Database:** Supabase or Firebase Firestore

- **Authentication:** Firebase Auth or Auth0

- **AI Parsing:** Connect to OpenAI/Gemini API for invoice text extraction and structuring
